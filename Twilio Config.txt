In order to send a templated message, you include the full body of the message in the API call. 
Twilio will send the message as an templated message if it matches one of the approved templates. 
If the Body does not match a pre-registered template, the message will be sent as a freeform message,
which may fail if it is outside a WhatsApp session (see below).

You can have customers initiate a conversation with you on WhatsApp via URL schemes,
 embedded in web / mobile apps. If the user has WhatsApp IOS, Android or desktop installed,
 clicking the deep link will open a conversation with you inside the app.

Deep link format : whatsapp://send?phone=<e164 number>&text=Hello!
